 * Store interface + persisted DTOs for the Polyptic control plane.

 * The Store is the durable home of the registry: machines, screens (incl. their friendly name),
 * per-screen content (canvas + surfaces), and the global revision counter. The control plane keeps
 * an in-memory working copy and WRITES THROUGH to the Store on every mutation; on boot it LOADs the
 * persisted state back into memory and resumes the revision.
 *
 * `PostgresStore` is the product storage (default). `MemoryStore` is a test double with identical
 * semantics. Both implement this interface so the rest of the server never knows which is live.
 *
 * The persisted DTOs are structurally aligned with the protocol's `Machine` / `Screen` / `ScreenSlice`
 * so values flow between storage and the wire without translation, but they are declared here
 * explicitly to keep storage decoupled from the message layer.
